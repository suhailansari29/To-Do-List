# To-Do-List
This is a To Do list website that uses HTML, CSS and JS to create a page where one can input the task and add it on the list. Then when it is done they can cut it out as well, and if they want they can delete it as well. This uses various JS/window methods to perform the tasks, such as getElementById(), remove(), appendChild, etc.
